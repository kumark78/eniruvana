                      The interactive media buying business is a maze of complexities, which can prove a daunting task for eBusiness managers today.<br /><br />
                      With increasing fragmentation of audience profiles and a smorgasbord of websites to choose from, the plethora in-site options boggles the mind. Then there's the business of negotiating with the websites themselves and placing media at prime audience browsing times of day.<br /><br />
                      Here are some compelling reasons why you would choose an interactive agency to handle your media buying:<br /><br />
                   </p>
                   <div class="ful-cont-list">
                        <ul class="fnt-16 cl-engrey">
                            <li>Interactive is constantly evolving, hence here's a need for people with an online mindset to do this media full time. Traditional media planners would find it difficult to keep up with best practices in the digital world.</li>
                            <li>Because of its evolution almost at the speed of thought, media and creative need to work closely together, to optimize the strategy and end deliverable.</li>
                            <li>Emerging technologies constantly blur the line between media and content development. Smart marketers are already using these platforms to connect with audiences before they become common place. An interactive agency can accelerate your efforts to leverage this medium before the others</li>
                        </ul>
                   </div>
                   
              </div>
         </div>
         <div class="ful-cont-list">
              <ul class="fnt-16 cl-engrey">
                  <li>Online campaigns are often hardwired into the client's business model. As interactive agencies, we're often working not just on a client's online advertising, but also its business model, Web site, search marketing, and viral marketing. Keeping the same group working on all those efforts makes the overall interactive work stronger.</li>
                  <li>Online advertising campaigns work best when the same teams works on parallel online initiatives like website, online advertising, search, eMail marketing and more.</li>
